# Polymorph

Polymorph is a tool that facilitates the modification of network traffic on the fly by allowing the execution of Python code on network packets that are intercepted in real time.

This framework can be used to modify in real time network packets that implement any publicly specified network protocol. Additionally, it can be used to modify privately specified network protocols by creating custom abstractions and fields.

# Installation

Polymorph is specially designed to be installed and run on a Linux operating system. Before installing the framework, the following requirements must be installed:
```
sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev tshark tcpdump python3-pip wireshark git
```
After the installation of the dependencies, the framework itself can be installed with the Python pip package manager in the following way (to avoid errors, install Polymorph with the root user):
```
python -m venv polymorph_env
source polymorph_env/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/kti/python-netfilterqueue
pip install polymorph
```
